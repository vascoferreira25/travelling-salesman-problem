# Travelling Salesman Problem
Implementation of a Genetic Algorithm using Clojure. See the literate programming page: [Docs](https://vascoferreira25.github.io/travelling-salesman-problem/index.html)

> "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what
> is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the
> origin city?"
- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)

This implementations uses a genetic algorithm to find the shortest route
between cities.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/vascoferreira25/travelling-salesman-problem
```

## Run the program
First make the project folder your working directory:
```shell
cd travelling-salesman-problem
```

And then, either run it directly with:
```shell
lein run
```

or use the REPL and execute the main function:
```shell
lein repl
```

uncomment the last line
```clojure
(-main)
```

and execute the function.

## Docs and Literate Programming

This project has a literate programming page that walks the entire code to explain
everything that is done at each step.

## Purpose

Find the best possible route for a list of cities.
The cities are represented in the following chart:

![cities_map](./resources/cities_map.png "Map with the cities")

## Results

With the following parameters, the algorithm reached the result of `565.685424949238`:
- Generations: 10000,
- Population Size: 500,
- Mutation Rate: 0.1.
